# What is this all about?
This project provides examples on how to easily integrate communication services into an java application using clinj.

# Where do the services actually come from?
clinj is just an api library. The telecommunication service provider is sipgate. To use clinj, you need any 
sipgate account that grants telephone and api usage. This applies to any sipgate product except trunking. 

There are free trial periods for each product, so you can easily evaluate clinj without any further costs or risks. 

sipgate currently 
develops a single seat product designed for being integrated into third party software. This product consists of several 
components including an account providing api access, flatrates, fax and sms services and several more. 
This product is called clinq and is available ad https://www.clinq.in. 
(Any guesses what strongly influenced this librarys name?)

# Outlook and further reading

As you can see: This readme is quiet short. But it is evolving. As is this library.
Some more reading can be found at https://clinj.jmens.de. 
And to the library applies: What you can already get is working but lacks some features. 

I'm on both, the library and some more documentation. But the time I spend into it shares with my job and my family. 
The good thing is you can priorize how things going on. To start on, simply give me a feedback. It surely motivates if someone out there really will use clinj. Or would if this or that works better. Got the point? 

To get in touch, you can send an e-mail to mail@jmens.de or use the github issue tracker.

Just in case you didn't already guessed: This library is done to the best of my knowledge and believe, but it comes without any warranty...
